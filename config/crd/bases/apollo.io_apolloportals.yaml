                      description: Operator represents a key's relationship to the
                        value. Valid operators are Exists and Equal. Defaults to Equal.
                        Exists is equivalent to wildcard for value, so that a pod
                        can tolerate all taints of a particular category.

                      description: TolerationSeconds represents the period of time
                        the toleration (which must be of effect NoExecute, otherwise
                        this field is ignored) tolerates the taint. By default, it
                        is not set, which means tolerate the taint forever (do not
                        evict). Zero and negative values will be treated as 0 (evict
                        immediately) by the system.

                        to. If the operator is Exists, the value should be empty,
                        otherwise just a regular string.
